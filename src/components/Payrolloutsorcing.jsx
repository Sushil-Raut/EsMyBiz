          <h2>Why Payroll Outsourcing is a Smart Move for Your Business</h2>
          <p>
            Managing payroll in-house can be time-consuming, prone to errors,
            and exposes businesses to compliance risks. With changing tax laws,
            employee expectations, and statutory deadlines, even small mistakes
            can cost big.
          </p>

          <p>
            Payroll outsourcing gives you access to a team of experts who handle
            everything â€” from accurate salary processing to statutory filings â€”
            ensuring your business stays compliant and your employees paid on
            time.
